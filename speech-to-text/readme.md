## Key Optimizations for Faster Transcription

### GPU Acceleration
- Automatically detects and uses CUDA GPU if available
- Uses fp16 (half-precision) for faster GPU processing
- Falls back to CPU if no GPU is detected

### Parallel Processing
- Uses `ProcessPoolExecutor` for true parallel processing
- Automatically determines optimal number of workers based on CPU cores
- Allows manual worker count configuration
- Processes multiple videos simultaneously

### Flexible Configuration
- Choose Whisper model size (tiny to large)
- Adjust number of parallel workers
- Supports various video formats

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install openai-whisper torch
```

## GPU Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA-compatible GPU
- CUDA Toolkit installed

## Performance Tips
- Larger Whisper models (medium, large) are more accurate but slower
- More CPUs/workers can speed up processing
- GPU provides significant speedup over CPU

## Recommended for 4-hour video processing
- Use 'base' or 'small' model for faster processing
- Maximize parallel workers
- Use GPU if available

Would you like me to elaborate on any optimization strategies or help you set up the environment for GPU acceleration?
